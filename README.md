<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The Price Feed Simulator is a two-part application designed to generate and display simulated stock price data in real time. It consists of a Data Generator and a Data Feed UI, working in parallel to create and visualize financial market data.

**Data Generator:**

This module generates realistic stock data for up to 10,000 tickers, including fields such as bid price, ask price, last price, and quote time (UTC). It updates the data at configurable intervals, ensuring a dynamic and diverse data feed. Updates are distributed evenly among tickers, providing a realistic simulation of market activity.

**Data Feed UI:**

A user-friendly console application that receives and displays the data from the generator. Users can query current data for specific tickers, view real-time updates, access the last 10 updates for a ticker, calculate a 5-minute moving average, or identify the top 10 tickers with the largest price changes since startup.

Together, these applications simulate a real-time stock market environment, providing a practical tool for analyzing and visualizing dynamic price movements.
